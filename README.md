This was from a Thinkful project that asked me to create the fizzbuzz app, which is a series of if statements nested within a for loop.

The purpose is to output a 'fizz' everytime a multiple of 3 appears, a 'buzz' everytime a multiple of 5 appears, and a 'fizzbuzz' when a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
